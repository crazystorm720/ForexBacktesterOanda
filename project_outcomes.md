### `src/data/data_ingestion.py`

```python
import datetime
import argparse
import oandapyV20
import oandapyV20.endpoints.instruments as instruments
from config.keys import OANDA_API_KEY
from src.data.database import create_connection, save_data_to_db

def fetch_historical_data(instrument, granularity, count):
    client = oandapyV20.API(access_token=OANDA_API_KEY)
    params = {
        "granularity": granularity,
        "count": count
    }
    request = instruments.InstrumentsCandles(instrument=instrument, params=params)
    try:
        response = client.request(request)
        candles = response['candles']
        return candles
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching data: {e}")
        return []

def ingest_historical_data(instrument, granularity, count):
    data = fetch_historical_data(instrument, granularity, count)
    if not data:
        print("No data to save.")
        return
    conn = create_connection()
    if conn:
        save_data_to_db(conn, data)
        conn.close()
    else:
        print("Failed to create database connection.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Ingest historical forex data.')
    parser.add_argument('--instrument', type=str, default='EUR_USD', help='Forex instrument (e.g., EUR_USD)')
    parser.add_argument('--granularity', type=str, default='H1', help='Data granularity (e.g., H1 for hourly)')
    parser.add_argument('--days', type=int, default=180, help='Number of days of historical data to fetch')

    args = parser.parse_args()

    instrument = args.instrument
    granularity = args.granularity
    end_date = datetime.datetime.now()
    start_date = end_date - datetime.timedelta(days=args.days)
    count = int((end_date - start_date).total_seconds() // 3600)  # Number of hours in specified days

    ingest_historical_data(instrument, granularity, count)
```

### `src/data/database.py`

```python
import sqlite3

def create_connection():
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect('data/forex_data.db')
        create_table(conn)
        return conn
    except sqlite3.Error as e:
        print(f"Error creating connection: {e}")
        return None

def create_table(conn):
    sql = '''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS forex_data (
                 id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                 timestamp TEXT,
                 open REAL,
                 high REAL,
                 low REAL,
                 close REAL,
                 volume INTEGER
             )'''
    try:
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute(sql)
    except sqlite3.Error as e:
        print(f"Error creating table: {e}")

def save_data_to_db(conn, data):
    sql = '''INSERT INTO forex_data (timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume)
             VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)'''
    try:
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        for candle in data:
            timestamp = candle['time']
            open_price = float(candle['mid']['o'])
            high_price = float(candle['mid']['h'])
            low_price = float(candle['mid']['l'])
            close_price = float(candle['mid']['c'])
            volume = int(candle['volume'])
            cursor.execute(sql, (timestamp, open_price, high_price, low_price, close_price, volume))
        conn.commit()
    except sqlite3.Error as e:
        print(f"Error saving data: {e}")
```

In the `data_ingestion.py` file:

- The `fetch_historical_data` function retrieves historical forex data from the Oanda API using the specified instrument, granularity, and count.
- The `ingest_historical_data` function calls `fetch_historical_data` to retrieve the data and then saves it to the SQLite database using the `save_data_to_db` function from `database.py`.
- The script accepts command-line arguments for the instrument, granularity, and the number of days of historical data to fetch.

In the `database.py` file:

- The `create_connection` function establishes a connection to the SQLite database and creates the necessary table if it doesn't exist.
- The `create_table` function creates the `forex_data` table with the specified schema.
- The `save_data_to_db` function inserts the fetched forex data into the `forex_data` table using parameterized queries.

To fetch historical data and store it in the database, you can run the `data_ingestion.py` script with the desired arguments. For example:

```shell
python src/data/data_ingestion.py --instrument EUR_USD --granularity H1 --days 180
```

This command will fetch historical data for the EUR/USD instrument with an hourly granularity (H1) for the last 180 days and store it in the `data/forex_data.db` SQLite database.

Make sure to update the `config/keys.py` file with your Oanda API key before running the script.

With these updates, the data ingestion and database modules are set up to fetch historical forex data from the Oanda API and store it in an SQLite database for further analysis and backtesting.

Certainly! Here's an updated project directory structure that includes the `environment.yml` and `requirements.txt` files, along with the touch commands to create all the necessary project folders and files:

```shell
ForexBacktesterOanda/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── config/
│   └── keys.py
├── data/
│   └── forex_data.db
├── environment.yml
├── requirements.txt
├── src/

touch src/data/data_ingestion.py src/data/database.py
touch src/strategies/moving_average_crossover.py
touch src/main.py
touch tests/test_data_ingestion.py tests/test_strategies.py
```

Now, let's create the `environment.yml` file:

```yaml
name: forexbacktesteroanda
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.9
  - pip
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - requests
  - sqlite
  - pytest
  - pip:
      - oandapyV20
```

And the `requirements.txt` file:

```
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
requests
oandapyV20
```

The `environment.yml` file is used to create a Conda environment with the specified dependencies, while the `requirements.txt` file is used to install additional dependencies using pip.

To create the Conda environment using the `environment.yml` file, run the following command:

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create a new Conda environment named `forexbacktesteroanda` with the specified dependencies.

To activate the environment, run:

```shell
conda activate forexbacktesteroanda
```

After activating the environment, you can install any additional dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using pip:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

With these files and commands, you have a complete project directory structure along with the necessary build files (`environment.yml` and `requirements.txt`) to set up the development environment for the ForexBacktesterOanda project.

Remember to add the `config/keys.py` file to your `.gitignore` file to avoid accidentally committing your API keys to version control.

```shell
echo "config/keys.py" >> .gitignore
```

You can now proceed with implementing the project code in the respective files and directories.

---

Certainly! Let's containerize the ForexBacktesterOanda project using Docker. We'll create a Dockerfile to define the container image and a docker-compose.yml file to manage the services and their configurations.

Here's an example of how you can structure your Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml:

Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY src/ ./src/
COPY config/ ./config/
COPY data/ ./data/

CMD ["python", "src/main.py"]
```

Explanation:
- The Dockerfile starts with the Python 3.9 base image.
- It sets the working directory to `/app` inside the container.
- It copies the `requirements.txt` file and installs the project dependencies using `pip`.
- It copies the `src/`, `config/`, and `data/` directories into the container.
- The `CMD` instruction specifies the command to run when the container starts, which is executing the `main.py` script.

docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  forex-backtester:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app/src
      - ./config:/app/config
      - ./data:/app/data
    environment:
      - OANDA_API_KEY=${OANDA_API_KEY}
```

Explanation:
- The docker-compose.yml file defines a single service named `forex-backtester`.
- It builds the container image using the Dockerfile in the current directory (`.`).
- It mounts the `src/`, `config/`, and `data/` directories as volumes, allowing changes made in the host machine to be reflected in the container.
- It sets the `OANDA_API_KEY` environment variable using the value from the host machine's environment.

To run the project using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and set the `OANDA_API_KEY` variable with your Oanda API key:
   ```
   OANDA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Open a terminal, navigate to the project root directory, and run the following command to build and start the containers:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will build the container image and start the `forex-backtester` service.

4. To run the backtester, execute the following command:
   ```
   docker-compose run forex-backtester python src/backtester/backtester.py
   ```

   This command will run the `backtester.py` script inside the `forex-backtester` container.

5. To stop the containers, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal or run the following command in a separate terminal:
   ```
   docker-compose down
   ```

   This command will stop and remove the containers.

By containerizing the project with Docker, you ensure a consistent runtime environment across different machines and make it easier to deploy and scale the application.

Remember to update the `requirements.txt` file with any additional dependencies your project requires, and adjust the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file as needed based on your project's specific requirements.
